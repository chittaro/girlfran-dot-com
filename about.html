            <div>
                <p>Ava Kassarjian Tikekar. From 13913 Saben Ct Carmel, Indiana. or 507 Detroit St Michigan Ann Arbor (awkwar). She is my shorty for real on god. Also a weirdo and a freak.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Hey why are you asking? Get away from my woman. But ig if you really wanna know, she's probably locked the fuck in on hacking into the main frame of lobster EECS 280 in the ugli. Yeah she's kinda CS like that. Lowkey she could also be found chilling on north campus with a nice celsius and lindor to keep her on that grind. But if you check her FindMy, chances are she will be lurking the corners of Fifth and Packard. Probably for some project team meeting or something? Who knows.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>I don't know man. I've been asking myself this question every freaking day and I still got nothing. It could perhaps be her big ol cheekbone smile. Or her little giggly girgle at the dumbest shit (being sophomore) but then it gets me laughing till I can't even see properly. It could also be her coat mating dance that probs cast a spell on me or something. But most likely its her knockers.</p>
