                <p>Ava Kassarjian Tikekar. From 13913 Saben Ct Carmel, Indiana. or 507 Detroit St Michigan Ann Arbor (awkwar). She is my shorty for real on god. Also a weirdo and a freak.</p>

                <p>I don't know man. I've been asking myself this question every freaking day and I still got nothing. It could perhaps be her big ol cheekbone smile. Or her little giggly girgle at the dumbest shit (being sophomore) but then it gets me laughing till I can't even see properly. It could also be her coat mating dance that probs cast a spell on me or something. But most likely its her knockers.</p>
